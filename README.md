# Net_Practice

## Project Overview

**Net_Practice** is a networking fundamentals project that simulates the configuration of small-scale networks. The goal was to apply core networking concepts—especially TCP/IP addressing—to solve connectivity issues in a series of virtual scenarios.

The project consists of **10 levels**, each presenting a non-functional network that i had to diagnose and fix. These networks include routers, hosts, and switches, and my task was to correctly assign IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to ensure full communication.

This project is browser-based and uses a custom visual interface to simulate real-world networking tasks.

## Key Concepts

- IP addressing and subnetting
- Routing basics
- Network masks and CIDR notation
- Default gateways and host-device relationships
- How devices within the same or different networks communicate

---

## Training Interface

- Each level displays a **network diagram** and a **goal** at the top.
- Configure IP addresses and routes to meet the goal.

### Tools Available:
- **[Check again]** – Verifies whether the configuration is valid.
- **[Get my config]** – Downloads the solution for submission.
- **[Next level]** – Appears once the current level is successfully completed.

## Requirements

- Proper understanding of TCP/IP and routing
- Ability to apply subnetting logic
